# Learning goals and challenges:
This assignment helped me learn the Restful API implementation using FastAPI. I have learnt using Swagger interface to test out my APIs. I have learnt integrating PostgreSQL into my Restful API application. Learnt Docker configuration to PostgreSQL. 

I have learnt the importance of testing out my code as I develop features into my application. Unit testing is one of the most valuable but most underrated skills. 

I have learnt implementing regular expressions for validating inputs. This is one of the most useful utility that can and should be done at the client side first. 

I had challenges with converting the login form to take json input so that it could match with the registration API.

Overall, this assignment is a full fledged application that ties the GUI interface till the database and touches upon all aspects of a real world software aaplication development model including deployment.
